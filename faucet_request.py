Please complete the following fields and run the student tests to verify
that you are ready to make a faucet request and the faucet is online

Once you have successfully completed the "run tests" you can submit this
assignment to have funds transferred to your account. This assignment
does not count towards your grade, and you only have to complete it if
you want an AVAX or BNB funds "drip" from the course account.

***NOTE***
Please keep the account and private key somewhere safe so that you can
reuse this account for future assignments that require you to use a
"funded" account.

***Please do not use an account that you use for real funds.***
